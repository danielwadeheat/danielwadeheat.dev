# danielwadeheat.dev

- The professional portfolio of Daniel Wade Heatherly, highlighting and showcasing HTML, CSS, light JavaScript, and soon-to-be NodeJS skills learned through school '25-'26.

- I built this unique, modern portfolio, as a multi-page responsive, accessible website containing a Home overview page, About Me page, Projects page (will add as I create more), Resume page, and Contact Me page, with a mobile-first approach.

- It contains sublte easter eggs that display unique personality and creativity.
